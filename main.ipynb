      "This money passed and OK, what are the two things fail and give a sample of it.\n",
      "0:1:17.590 --> 0:1:19.740\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Hey this is how it is failed and.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what value we are bringing to the client here?\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So we just, we are validating that no prompt flows, right?\n",
      "0:1:28.130 --> 0:1:28.340QA\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:1:27.450 --> 0:1:31.180\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So whatever attacks that you was mentioning, it is failing in math ingestion.\n",
      "0:1:31.290 --> 0:1:33.60\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK, it is failing in basic injection.\n",
      "0:1:31.720 --> 0:1:34.20A\n",
      "Rinisha  MZ\n",
      "Umm hmm.\n",
      "0:1:33.530 --> 0:1:34.940\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So why it is failing?\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",

      "0:1:39.650 --> 0:1:41.460\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",

      "OK.\n",

      "So yeah.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:1:45.20 --> 0:1:46.620\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what I see here is we care.\n",
      "0:1:46.630 --> 0:1:52.930\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "We have to come up with a possible attack types and you know, come up with the, you know, test cases.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Good.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "0:1:52.940 --> 0:1:59.930\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Meaning for each attack type we have to come up with the prompts and that has to be injected and it has.\n",
      "0:1:59.940 --> 0:2:0.230\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:2:0.240 --> 0:2:0.770\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah, got it.\n",
      "0:2:0.780 --> 0:2:1.250\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "0:2:1.300 --> 0:2:2.220\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, OK, Sir.\n",
      "0:2:5.930 --> 0:2:6.140\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:2:8.780 --> 0:2:10.320\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm, sure.\n",
      "0:2:1.390 --> 0:2:13.620\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So OK, so here you can also define like either you predefine some prompts to be tested, tested with or you can also provide a configuration.\n",
      "0:2:18.10 --> 0:2:18.230\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:2:13.630 --> 0:2:22.250\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "You can load it from another JSON file where user can define also like hey I have some something I wanted to test also while doing this.\n",
      "0:2:22.680 --> 0:2:26.410\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So, uh, so correct.\n",
      "0:2:28.10 --> 0:2:28.200\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "0:2:21.780 --> 0:2:31.180\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah, we can introduce into the system prompts, which is the default one, and we can also add the users system prompt into it and then yeah, got it.\n",
      "0:2:29.370 --> 0:2:31.440\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK, exactly.\n",
      "0:2:31.450 --> 0:2:34.80\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So then that way we are giving flexibility.\n",
      "0:2:34.250 --> 0:2:37.680\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So otherwise it's it's going to be hard coded with our templates along.\n",
      "0:2:37.690 --> 0:2:40.330\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Alright, we are generating only with our, you know?\n",
      "0:2:38.190 --> 0:2:41.270\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Umm so it it will be like a closed source.\n",
      "0:2:41.730 --> 0:2:42.770\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, so we.\n",
      "0:2:42.0 --> 0:2:45.910\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So when you say user whom are you or a friend the client.\n",
      "0:2:50.910 --> 0:2:51.90\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:2:46.930 --> 0:2:52.940\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh, see, when it when it comes to the tool, I'm saying, but right now you're generating a suit.\n",
      "0:2:55.810 --> 0:2:56.60\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:2:52.950 --> 0:2:57.120\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Means OK, you are running through with a suit and with the test cases.\n",
      "0:2:58.830 --> 0:3:0.240\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "I have predefined test cases.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Sure. Umm.\n",

      "0:2:58.70 --> 0:3:12.160\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh predefined test cases or you can write new test cases also like you know I I can the dynamically create new test cases and add it inside so that it can take those test cases also on run long run along with it.\n",
      "0:3:12.590 --> 0:3:13.370\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "0:3:13.260 --> 0:3:15.890\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So we could the privilege to the client also, right?\n",
      "0:3:16.850 --> 0:3:17.750\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah. So.\n",
      "0:3:17.640 --> 0:3:20.530\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So maybe you said acceptance testing, right?\n",
      "0:3:21.230 --> 0:3:22.650\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "That 30.\n",
      "0:3:20.540 --> 0:3:28.60\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "I guess the that that that's where you're saying the user can, we can just give that luxury of adding their prompts also.\n",
      "0:3:28.500 --> 0:3:28.810\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Got it.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh, and uh, how this could be useful and what is the capability that we are bringing up and just, you know, putting in A1 slider we need to think through that and put like let's say let's start now, but how we can shape that slide better, OK how do we put that and project Sr capability OK and accelerator kind of a thing right.\n",

      "0:4:28.650 --> 0:4:28.920\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Or.\n",
      "0:4:22.260 --> 0:4:31.750\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "No, actually, yes, we are getting this one, but my concern is like what is whatever I did it not it validating the LLM S output.\n",
      "0:4:31.820 --> 0:4:34.730\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So at firstly we need to highlight our input.\n",
      "0:4:34.960 --> 0:4:39.40\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So the concept you are saying like this is a harnessing this.\n",
      "0:4:40.600 --> 0:4:43.90\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Do you limpet, and that is the quarantine and the privilege.\n",
      "0:4:43.420 --> 0:4:43.630\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:4:44.710 --> 0:4:48.900\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So we can be used this one as a our quarantine.\n",
      "0:4:48.910 --> 0:4:53.800\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "LLM and this output like whatever is a or output.\n",
      "0:4:56.980 --> 0:4:57.320\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:4:57.380 --> 0:4:59.60\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So then then.\n",
      "0:4:53.810 --> 0:5:1.570\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "It's generated like if it is a path right for this at that time, so we can then pass it to our privilege LLM this prompt.\n",
      "0:5:1.630 --> 0:5:7.910\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Otherwise we just reject it and send the message like whatever the user answer like you are not.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "0:5:9.810 --> 0:5:17.960\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Can you can you also define that in the deck like you know validation of input and output like you know input validation or output validation.\n",
      "0:5:18.720 --> 0:5:19.30\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:5:18.520 --> 0:5:24.120\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh, just define that how this can be tested in the suite?\n",
      "0:5:24.690 --> 0:5:26.200\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "How it can be defined the parameter?\n",
      "0:5:23.900 --> 0:5:28.270\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So just just we, yeah, the our yeah.\n",
      "0:5:30.160 --> 0:5:30.750\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, sure.\n",
      "0:5:27.180 --> 0:5:31.890\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Akash, can you show the next sheet also maybe that would have a.\n",
      "0:5:35.20 --> 0:5:35.230\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:5:32.310 --> 0:5:35.400\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we have prepared another sheet, OK.\n",
      "0:5:35.180 --> 0:5:35.680\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So yeah.\n",
      "0:5:37.620 --> 0:5:37.830\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:5:37.590 --> 0:5:43.890\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So these are so these are the possible approaches what we can take to avoid this.\n",
      "0:5:45.410 --> 0:5:47.440\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "You know attacks, so one.\n",
      "0:5:47.450 --> 0:5:49.280\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Is this a constitutionally AI?\n",
      "0:5:49.410 --> 0:5:51.480\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So that is from anthrop.\n",
      "0:5:51.670 --> 0:5:52.220\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "0:5:51.990 --> 0:5:53.590\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Uh, entropic entropic, yes.\n",
      "0:5:53.60 --> 0:5:53.810\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "And the applicant.\n",
      "0:5:52.230 --> 0:5:54.60\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Anthropic anthropic.\n",
      "0:5:54.110 --> 0:5:54.750\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",

      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Cloud 2, Lord yeah.\n",
      "0:5:54.990 --> 0:6:2.860\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So they have come up with the one AI, right, Claudia or something, but something similar there.\n",
      "0:6:4.970 --> 0:6:5.160\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:6:4.940 --> 0:6:5.450\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:6:5.510 --> 0:6:5.680\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So.\n",
      "0:6:6.860 --> 0:6:8.460\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm. Ohh.\n",
      "0:5:59.50 --> 0:6:9.220\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Cloud Cloud Cloud Cloud is a like a similar to Turbo 3.5 cloud is also yeah, but there is also good actually that good model, but it is commercial side.\n",
      "0:6:9.350 --> 0:6:10.510\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So that is only drawback.\n",
      "0:6:10.380 --> 0:6:10.890\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:6:10.980 --> 0:6:11.320\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:6:11.330 --> 0:6:12.460\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "What they're saying is there.\n",
      "0:6:19.180 --> 0:6:19.770\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "I know, I know.\n",
      "0:6:10.830 --> 0:6:22.90\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So actually, uh, entropic, just as per my knowledge they collaborate with like AWS, AWS invested 4 billion into it and yeah better obviously.\n",
      "0:6:23.960 --> 0:6:24.300\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "0:6:19.780 --> 0:6:25.180\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "They're they're in the bedrock right now, so they're they're they're in the bedrock. But still.\n",
      "0:6:25.190 --> 0:6:28.750\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, I think opening is competitive.\n",
      "0:6:28.760 --> 0:6:34.510\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Bedrock is good, but bedrock they have made it like you know, kind of bringing your own order into bedrock.\n",
      "0:6:32.410 --> 0:6:36.260\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "We cannot use in like in India and other part of the world.\n",
      "0:6:39.890 --> 0:6:40.50\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:6:36.320 --> 0:6:41.230\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So they focusing only about Europe and the US and so that's why.\n",
      "0:6:43.250 --> 0:6:43.490\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:6:43.450 --> 0:6:45.220\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So these are like constitutional AI.\n",
      "0:6:45.590 --> 0:6:52.120\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So like as a rinisha said, they write some construction for the AI and.\n",
      "0:6:51.410 --> 0:7:2.440\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So here Charan what they are doing is they are writing a constitution, meaning they are writing a A, you know, a set of rules for example they are in anthropic.\n",
      "0:7:7.760 --> 0:7:7.980\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:7:2.450 --> 0:7:9.780\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "What they're doing is they're taking it all from United Nations rules would be their right for the betterment of humanity.\n",
      "0:7:10.340 --> 0:7:10.590\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:7:10.90 --> 0:7:20.40\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So all of that they are taking or any for technology, this thing they are taking the license and agreement of Apple, OK.\n",
      "0:7:20.60 --> 0:7:20.260\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:7:20.50 --> 0:7:23.260\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So all that that that would be there Constitution.\n",
      "0:7:23.490 --> 0:7:28.520\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what they are doing is they are the training a model on top of it.\n",
      "0:7:28.890 --> 0:7:29.940\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Again, LLM.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:7:29.950 --> 0:7:31.640\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Only there are training.\n",
      "0:7:31.730 --> 0:7:44.390\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "The LLM on top of it, and that LLM would be able to evaluate whether this is the incoming prompt is violating the rules or not based on the Constitution.\n",
      "0:7:43.540 --> 0:7:45.290\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah. Understood.\n",
      "0:7:45.300 --> 0:7:45.740\n",

      "0:7:45.780 --> 0:8:2.140\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So this is something similar to, assume no assures uh are responsibly OK, So what Azure is having responsibly, but that is like a high level the same thing so high level meaning.\n",
      "0:8:2.820 --> 0:8:4.110\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh, a?\n",

      "0:8:8.450 --> 0:8:15.0\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "60 securities that when they put the model in cloud, they wanted to check those things.\n",

      "0:8:24.400 --> 0:8:53.731\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Umm, but other aspect they that those things will capture right so or else like you know if that is 1 aspect like every cloud provider is going to provide that uh eventually end of the day like you know open a Azure is providing 1 even at AWS is going to provide one right by default we can leverage that and put but these are like good things that we can add it into it but one way of doing this and then how do I E.\n",
      "0:8:55.560 --> 0:8:58.890\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK, let's say contest like with this constitutional means, there are certain policies will be placed on to country level or even generic level that I'm going to validate OK that.\n",
      "0:9:31.330 --> 0:9:31.900\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",

      "0:9:35.390 --> 0:9:38.580\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So yeah, it is the counterpart of RLHF.\n",
      "0:9:38.630 --> 0:9:40.940\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "There human feedback here.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we here we have come up with the pros and cons of for each of it though.\n",
      "0:9:49.760 --> 0:9:50.730\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "What would be the cons?\n",
      "0:9:51.560 --> 0:9:57.230\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Because if you see uh based on the Constitution, if it is biased then the I also will be biased.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Would this be, you know, helpful for us in case of any client engagements?\n",
      "0:10:27.30 --> 0:10:27.330\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",

      "0:10:29.510 --> 0:10:33.920\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Because uh, this definitely would be useful.\n",
      "0:10:32.780 --> 0:10:41.860\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "How can we bring the value out of it so these are the approaches but when it comes to the client work, how can we bring value out of these things?\n",
      "0:10:40.920 --> 0:10:54.10\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "See correct that is what we need to think through for each use case or something in according to like you know, let's say if I am launching a conversational AI chat bot public public one.\n",
      "0:11:2.440 --> 0:11:2.720\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "0:10:54.60 --> 0:11:9.390\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK, so that public one uh, ask to be properly responding if it is opening up differently then it's going to be, you know big problem right.\n",
      "0:11:9.510 --> 0:11:22.20\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So before launching to public, let's say uh for example, you are providing a a fake O gene based chat bot app for, you know.\n",
      "0:11:22.740 --> 0:11:28.370\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",

      "0:11:34.800 --> 0:11:38.0\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So that has to be secured in a way.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "If I asked uh something related to that, you know.\n",
      "0:11:43.850 --> 0:11:49.920\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh, policy wise, it should not be a funded like you know it should.\n",
      "0:11:49.930 --> 0:11:56.180\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "It should promptly respond in a way stating that you know, hey, I can able to only answer this type of things.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",

      "0:11:58.640 --> 0:12:7.490\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "It should be able to capture so by tricking the you know chat board and people still try to break things right?\n",
      "0:12:7.660 --> 0:12:11.250\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So how do we that is that is what we need to figure out.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Like you know, if I track that still does it going to respond in a different way because that is what people are trying to do always.\n",

      "0:17:7.190 --> 0:17:7.400\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:16:55.610 --> 0:17:7.740\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So this way of you know capabilities we tested like in this life cycle, we we go and do it and then enterprise level like that we are gonna state at high level points that's all OK.\n",
      "0:17:9.270 --> 0:17:9.680\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:17:8.730 --> 0:17:10.440\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So that will define like it'll give.\n",
      "0:17:9.690 --> 0:17:12.900\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we will translate this into a deck, OK.\n",
      "0:17:12.610 --> 0:17:12.970\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "0:17:12.950 --> 0:17:14.20\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So I'm presentable deck.\n",
      "0:17:14.30 --> 0:17:14.520\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "0:17:13.10 --> 0:17:14.780\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Exactly. Yeah.\n",
      "0:17:14.730 --> 0:17:24.280\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So apart from this, I think that OK, so that is 1 testing tool and the other one is the presentation and the other one is the POC right?\n",
      "0:17:24.290 --> 0:17:42.770\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "I guess we can if we are doing a POC on this constitutionally I right, it might make some sense because when it comes to a specific client, if you're doing a I mean fine tuning and LLM for a specific client on their domain data, right?\n",
      "0:17:42.940 --> 0:17:50.940\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what happens is that a client they would be having like apples, they would be having their own set of license and agreement and set of rules.\n",
      "0:17:51.140 --> 0:17:56.350\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we can have that as a Constitution and then we can, you know, train it right.\n",
      "0:17:56.360 --> 0:17:57.770\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So maybe umm.\n",
      "0:17:58.350 --> 0:18:1.0\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So with that, we can attract the clients, right?\n",
      "0:18:1.10 --> 0:18:8.740\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, we have this kind of approach so that it is going to safeguard your data or the LLM.\n",
      "0:18:10.60 --> 0:18:13.430\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So this would be one potential POC area. I guess.\n",
      "0:18:13.700 --> 0:18:14.300\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "0:18:15.480 --> 0:18:15.720\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:18:15.730 --> 0:18:16.530\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, definitely, yeah.\n",
      "0:18:17.510 --> 0:18:17.790\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:18:17.940 --> 0:18:21.440\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So I have now some questions like you suggested.\n",
      "0:18:21.450 --> 0:18:23.30\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "This uh reboot, right?\n",
      "0:18:23.680 --> 0:18:29.10\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So actually I tried it but it won't be able to connect with like this playground.\n",
      "0:18:29.100 --> 0:18:32.930\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So I tried there 2/3 API they provided.\n",
      "0:18:33.380 --> 0:18:39.40\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So for this one they said just like it is exhausted, makes it tries and.\n",
      "0:18:38.720 --> 0:18:42.30\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So yeah, geddam what we noticed this rebug.\n",
      "0:18:42.120 --> 0:18:45.900\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah, they have a some good work, but you know.\n",
      "0:18:48.40 --> 0:18:48.240\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:18:45.820 --> 0:18:48.540\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "It's in alpha stage actually, not even in beta.\n",
      "0:18:52.610 --> 0:18:56.180\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Or it might be like it is in development stage early development stage.\n",
      "0:18:56.970 --> 0:19:1.20\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So yeah, so this is like a yeah, we went through this.\n",
      "0:19:1.450 --> 0:19:5.750\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So we can this is nothing, but there are dedicated right the quarantine.\n",
      "0:19:5.760 --> 0:19:7.440\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "LLM and check it.\n",
      "0:19:9.980 --> 0:19:10.140\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Hello.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Sorry, once again I kind of lost for a moment.\n",
      "0:19:12.960 --> 0:19:14.890\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Of OK.\n",

      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Can you come back for a moment, please?\n",
      "0:19:18.990 --> 0:19:23.380\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Actually like we are looking like this river playground.\n",
      "0:19:23.860 --> 0:19:24.40\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:19:23.610 --> 0:19:25.240\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So but it will help us stage.\n",
      "0:19:25.710 --> 0:19:31.720\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "But what we say that like we understand these things like it is our full ways like our system roles or constitution.\n",
      "0:19:32.930 --> 0:19:33.470\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "And I, yeah.\n",
      "0:19:31.730 --> 0:19:35.640\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "We can say that then it comes for the LLM.\n",
      "0:19:35.650 --> 0:19:37.140\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Check it is our quarantine.\n",
      "0:19:37.150 --> 0:19:56.520\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "LLM or dedicated LLM so they didn't mention which LLM they are using or it is a custom tune or defined tuned it or they directly use some like validation LLM it never mentioned but there is another like this is the vector DB check so I didn't get that much idea from this one.\n",
      "0:19:56.610 --> 0:19:58.450\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Is it like output testing?\n",
      "0:19:58.460 --> 0:20:4.580\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Or maybe just input to output relation mapping the context mapping Interment.\n",
      "0:20:5.110 --> 0:20:10.650\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "I didn't get this one and the users I think, yeah, these three chicks.\n",
      "0:20:10.700 --> 0:20:14.220\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Because you had mentioned that a rebirth in one of these slides.\n",
      "0:20:14.230 --> 0:20:14.600\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "0:20:14.540 --> 0:20:14.700\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:20:14.810 --> 0:20:15.370\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Correct, correct.\n",
      "0:20:19.200 --> 0:20:19.430\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:20:14.610 --> 0:20:19.850\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we try to explore, but it looks like not a matured framework.\n",
      "0:20:20.160 --> 0:20:21.290\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Yeah. Ohh.\n",
      "0:20:27.940 --> 0:20:28.190\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:20:19.440 --> 0:20:29.700\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, it's not matured, but even IBM client was asking OK, do you have anything to show in that three buff, but only?\n",
      "0:20:28.570 --> 0:20:30.140\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah, but uh for this.\n",
      "0:20:30.150 --> 0:20:32.240\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Like there is another uh report like this.\n",
      "0:20:32.250 --> 0:20:39.880\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So there is it this prompt for actually they already did some test test and they generally use it like.\n",
      "0:20:40.770 --> 0:20:47.720\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Ohh on these cases so there is and it's like, uh, just production either two days ago.\n",
      "0:20:49.80 --> 0:20:49.490\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:20:50.110 --> 0:20:50.390\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Ohh.\n",
      "0:20:53.460 --> 0:20:53.940\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Ah, see.\n",
      "0:20:49.950 --> 0:20:54.980\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So it is a good one, but it is a generally it works on like a out output.\n",
      "0:20:55.10 --> 0:20:57.200\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK, this is this is something cool, right?\n",
      "0:20:57.210 --> 0:20:57.950\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So this is what?\n",
      "0:20:58.860 --> 0:20:59.570\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "You want that?\n",
      "0:20:59.680 --> 0:21:0.320\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK. OK.\n",
      "0:20:59.820 --> 0:21:1.920\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, we want we want to ship.\n",
      "0:21:0.960 --> 0:21:3.650\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So you like saying like a report generation like this?\n",
      "0:21:4.330 --> 0:21:4.590\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "0:21:4.80 --> 0:21:5.450\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "This is a question.\n",
      "0:21:5.520 --> 0:21:7.530\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "This is a pass or fail like OK.\n",
      "0:21:7.580 --> 0:21:7.870\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "0:21:8.50 --> 0:21:8.870\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:21:11.670 --> 0:21:12.50\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So this.\n",
      "0:21:11.470 --> 0:21:13.370\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, so it's prompt for OK.\n",
      "0:21:11.940 --> 0:21:17.210\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "But it is a prompt actually, and they like due to this kind of things.\n",
      "0:21:18.970 --> 0:21:19.150\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:18.720 --> 0:21:22.550\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So but it is on the output level the LLM S output.\n",
      "0:21:22.600 --> 0:21:23.420\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Uh validation.\n",
      "0:21:28.260 --> 0:21:29.30\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "See that?\n",
      "0:21:30.670 --> 0:21:31.120\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:31.330 --> 0:21:33.270\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Umm. Mm-hmm.\n",
      "0:21:29.40 --> 0:21:37.340\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "That is fine if someone has already done it, leverage it and try to create a generic one or not generic one which is.\n",
      "0:21:35.930 --> 0:21:40.380\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "But uh, like it is the NPX and maybe it is a react on the node JS app?\n",
      "0:21:40.390 --> 0:21:40.830\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "0:21:41.630 --> 0:21:42.340\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "React right.\n",
      "0:21:42.740 --> 0:21:42.900\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:42.710 --> 0:21:43.360\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "That is fine.\n",
      "0:21:43.370 --> 0:21:49.60\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So we have people who can, you know, uh, change react JS code, right.\n",
      "0:21:49.70 --> 0:21:50.80\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So we have team, right?\n",
      "0:21:50.750 --> 0:21:51.150\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "OK, OK.\n",
      "0:21:50.90 --> 0:21:51.850\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So everyone from our team.\n",
      "0:21:53.350 --> 0:21:55.90\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Yeah, not input level, that's why.\n",
      "0:21:51.30 --> 0:21:55.470\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Also, this is at output level, not at input level, so it's different.\n",
      "0:21:56.830 --> 0:21:59.200\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "It's at the LLM response level.\n",
      "0:21:59.310 --> 0:22:1.410\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So we are looking into the prompt level, right?\n",
      "0:22:1.790 --> 0:22:2.390\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:5.770 --> 0:22:6.710\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK. Umm.\n",
      "0:22:2.480 --> 0:22:7.310\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "No, we we we will have both both capabilities, OK that is fine.\n",
      "0:22:7.320 --> 0:22:16.990\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So that is what in the settings, maybe we can generate select based on the navigations we can select and now your you wanna validate generate a report based on output or input.\n",
      "0:22:17.740 --> 0:22:18.20\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "There.\n",
      "0:22:18.390 --> 0:22:21.140\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "So based on the selections, we can just generate the report.\n",
      "0:22:21.150 --> 0:22:21.470\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "0:22:21.960 --> 0:22:22.290\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:22:22.330 --> 0:22:22.760\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Got it. Yeah.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So the so as Charan mentioned that we will focus on this testing suit and you know come up with the slides too for better presentation of all the you know translate whatever given in the Excel to PPT.\n",
      "0:22:55.720 --> 0:22:56.100\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Check shipyard.\n",
      "0:23:4.690 --> 0:23:5.760\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Uh, that work.\n",
      "0:23:6.110 --> 0:23:6.350\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:23:6.450 --> 0:23:10.200\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, so we have BP and the other order automation also, right.\n",
      "0:23:14.910 --> 0:23:15.50\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "No.\n",
      "0:23:10.210 --> 0:23:19.530\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So I will take one and Akash will take a another one and apart from that I am concentrated on this higher bot also.\n",
      "0:23:20.100 --> 0:23:20.260\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:23:19.770 --> 0:23:23.940\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So maybe in a couple of days I will create the API for that.\n",
      "0:23:24.310 --> 0:23:24.540\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:23:24.10 --> 0:23:29.140\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "You know matching service because I evaluated llama index also.\n",
      "0:23:29.600 --> 0:23:29.860\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:23:39.270 --> 0:23:39.400\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "0:23:29.430 --> 0:23:41.490\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, so in the last couple of days I, you know tried to you know because I used llama index because it was mentioned in the article saying that it is better for searching and indexing, right?\n",
      "0:23:41.800 --> 0:23:42.40\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "0:23:41.640 --> 0:23:46.880\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "But what I noticed is if you see the framework right, it is very underdeveloped.\n",
      "0:23:49.690 --> 0:23:49.960\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:23:46.890 --> 0:23:59.220\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "You have to do lot of low level coding but if you see in the Lang chain they already have you know tons of high level coding, high level components that they have already created.\n",
      "0:23:59.390 --> 0:24:3.40\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So for example, if I have to do or metadata tagging right?\n",
      "0:24:3.170 --> 0:24:10.0\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So in a llama index there is no option for that, even if there is, it is not working perfectly.\n",
      "0:24:10.80 --> 0:24:14.820\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "You have to sit and, you know, do all that, you know, prompting and everything.\n",
      "0:24:14.930 --> 0:24:17.660\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "But here in langchain everything is already there.\n",
      "0:24:21.420 --> 0:24:21.640\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:24:17.730 --> 0:24:23.640\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what I noticed is if you see in the GitHub community, so in llama index, uh.\n",
      "0:24:23.650 --> 0:24:32.110\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Can you open that Akash llama index and lunch change if you see the contributors and the releases everything right?\n",
      "0:24:32.700 --> 0:24:39.670\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So llama index Lang chain is 5 times bigger as llama index, so it is a very fastly growing.\n",
      "0:24:39.680 --> 0:24:45.530\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what I think is it would maybe Overpass Llama index also maybe in a few days.\n",
      "0:24:46.620 --> 0:24:48.310\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "So llama index this one.\n",
      "0:24:45.540 --> 0:24:50.950\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "That's what I think as per my GitHub GitHub laminex GitHub.\n",
      "0:24:53.90 --> 0:24:58.320\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So here the contributes contribution is not as much as Lang Chain.\n",
      "0:24:59.260 --> 0:25:6.30\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So that's where again I thought, OK, I'll go ahead with Langchain itself because you know you have to do a lot of low level coding.\n",
      "0:25:6.40 --> 0:25:9.60\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So it's OK, so it's it has around 300.\n",
      "0:25:12.20 --> 0:25:12.840\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "One second, one second.\n",
      "0:25:12.850 --> 0:25:13.530\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "Just give me one second.\n",
      "0:25:13.960 --> 0:25:14.240\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:25:14.800 --> 0:25:16.890\n",
      "Sricharan Amarnath\n",
      "And texting PepsiCo team in second.\n",
      "0:25:17.450 --> 0:25:18.20\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Don't you?\n",
      "0:25:20.90 --> 0:25:22.110\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Scroll down showed the contributors OK.\n",
      "0:25:23.550 --> 0:25:26.220\n",

      "0:25:26.710 --> 0:25:27.0\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "0:25:27.10 --> 0:25:30.840\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",

      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "There is a noise better release.\n",

      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what you do is OK, go through this recording, OK and I will go through that IBP recording also.\n",
      "0:27:22.390 --> 0:27:22.650\n",
      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",

      "Akash Ambadas Salmuthe\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "0:27:25.970 --> 0:27:33.370\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, so each one focus on one thing and then we will, you know, come up with the generative AI capabilities for each of it.\n",
      "0:27:34.180 --> 0:27:35.590\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "OK, yeah.\n",
      "0:27:39.800 --> 0:27:41.40\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "Uh, have you sent the mail?\n",
      "0:27:42.650 --> 0:27:43.270\n",

      "0:27:53.470 --> 0:27:57.450\n",
      "Rinisha  M\n",
      "So what we do is we will allocate at least 10% every day for this work.\n",
