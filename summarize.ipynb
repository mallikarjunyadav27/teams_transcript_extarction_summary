      "sricharan amarnath like number test cases like basic injection sricharan amarnath happened sricharan amarnath uh know outcome high level insights right sricharan amarnath thats right rinisha ok sricharan amarnath finally use saying right sricharan amarnath also recommend also maybe recommendation take later right know summarizing testing attacks testing methodologies sricharan amarnath maybe could know showcase value later add ui top akash ambadas salmuthe basically dont like sricharan amarnath later 1st programmatically yeah sricharan amarnath exactly akash ambadas salmuthe uh passing one example akash ambadas salmuthe yeah sricharan amarnath one understand right one akash ambadas salmuthe yeah umm sricharan amarnath generic people understand need kind report right akash ambadas salmuthe ok sricharan amarnath need see sricharan amarnath hey ok sricharan amarnath lets say im developer developed tool give qa qa people test return sricharan amarnath return theyre gonna call showcase report right sricharan amarnath hey functionalities rinisha tested umm sricharan amarnath said yeah failed rinisha umm sricharan amarnath money passed ok two things fail give sample sricharan amarnath hey failed rinisha value bringing client sricharan amarnath validating prompt flows right 0128130 0128340qa rinisha umm sricharan amarnath whatever attacks mentioning failing math ingestion sricharan amarnath ok failing basic injection 0131720 013420a rinisha mz umm hmm sricharan amarnath failing rinisha umm sricharan amarnath change prompt like get outputs different way sricharan amarnath see security issue sricharan amarnath ok rinisha ok sricharan amarnath thats rinisha yeah rinisha yeah rinisha see care rinisha come possible attack types know come know test cases sricharan amarnath good sricharan amarnath exactly rinisha meaning attack type come prompts injected rinisha yeah rinisha yeah got rinisha got rinisha ok ok sir rinisha umm rinisha umm sure sricharan amarnath ok also define like either predefine prompts tested tested also provide configuration rinisha umm sricharan amarnath load another json file user define also like hey something wanted test also sricharan amarnath uh correct rinisha sure akash ambadas salmuthe yeah introduce system prompts default one also add users system prompt yeah got sricharan amarnath ok exactly sricharan amarnath way giving flexibility sricharan amarnath otherwise going hard coded templates along sricharan amarnath alright generating know akash ambadas salmuthe umm like closed source sricharan amarnath yeah rinisha say user friend client rinisha uh sricharan amarnath uh see comes tool im saying right youre generating suit rinisha umm sricharan amarnath means ok running suit test cases rinisha predefined test cases rinisha sure umm rinisha umm sricharan amarnath uh predefined test cases write new test cases also like know dynamically create new test cases add inside take test cases also run long run along rinisha umm ok akash ambadas salmuthe could privilege client also right sricharan amarnath yeah rinisha maybe said acceptance testing right sricharan amarnath 30 rinisha guess thats youre saying user give luxury adding prompts also sricharan amarnath got sricharan amarnath got sricharan amarnath exactly akash ambadas salmuthe umm rinisha ok sricharan amarnath uat thing would helpful rinisha good rinisha umm sricharan amarnath putting one slider let lets say wanted see like prompt testing validation going help ok high level like know uh lets say useful akash ambadas salmuthe mmhmm rinisha uh akash ambadas salmuthe umm rinisha akash ambadas salmuthe im working rinisha umm sricharan amarnath uh uh could useful capability bringing know putting a1 slider need think put like lets say lets start shape slide better ok put project sr capability ok accelerator kind thing right rinisha ok ok akash ambadas salmuthe sricharan amarnath something think putting creating deck rinisha yeah akash ambadas salmuthe rinisha yeah rinisha yeah thought one tool deck portray idea rinisha ok got sricharan amarnath right exactly exactly rinisha akash ambadas salmuthe actually yes getting one concern like whatever validating llm output akash ambadas salmuthe firstly need highlight input akash ambadas salmuthe concept saying like harnessing akash ambadas salmuthe limpet quarantine privilege akash ambadas salmuthe right sricharan amarnath yeah akash ambadas salmuthe used one quarantine akash ambadas salmuthe llm output like whatever output sricharan amarnath ok sricharan amarnath akash ambadas salmuthe generated like path right time pass privilege llm prompt akash ambadas salmuthe otherwise reject send message like whatever user answer like sricharan amarnath ok rinisha yeah sricharan amarnath also define deck like know validation input output like know input validation output validation rinisha umm sricharan amarnath uh define tested suite sricharan amarnath defined parameter akash ambadas salmuthe yeah yeah akash ambadas salmuthe yeah yeah sure rinisha akash show next sheet also maybe would sricharan amarnath ok rinisha prepared another sheet ok akash ambadas salmuthe yeah sricharan amarnath uh rinisha possible approaches take avoid rinisha know attacks one rinisha constitutionally ai rinisha anthrop rinisha akash ambadas salmuthe uh entropic entropic yes sricharan amarnath applicant rinisha anthropic anthropic rinisha yeah sricharan amarnath yeah akash ambadas salmuthe cloud 2 lord yeah rinisha come one ai right claudia something something similar akash ambadas salmuthe umm rinisha yeah rinisha rinisha umm ohh sricharan amarnath cloud cloud cloud cloud like similar turbo 35 cloud also yeah also good actually good model commercial side sricharan amarnath drawback rinisha yeah rinisha yeah rinisha theyre saying sricharan amarnath know know akash ambadas salmuthe actually uh entropic per knowledge collaborate like aws aws invested 4 billion yeah better obviously rinisha hmm sricharan amarnath theyre theyre bedrock right theyre theyre theyre bedrock still sricharan amarnath yeah think opening competitive sricharan amarnath bedrock good bedrock made like know kind bringing order bedrock akash ambadas salmuthe cannot use like india part world sricharan amarnath yeah akash ambadas salmuthe focusing europe us thats sricharan amarnath ok akash ambadas salmuthe like constitutional ai akash ambadas salmuthe like rinisha said write construction ai rinisha charan writing constitution meaning writing know set rules example anthropic akash ambadas salmuthe umm rinisha theyre theyre taking united nations rules would right betterment humanity sricharan amarnath uh rinisha taking technology thing taking license agreement apple ok sricharan amarnath uh rinisha would constitution rinisha training model top rinisha llm sricharan amarnath umm rinisha training rinisha llm top llm would able evaluate whether incoming prompt violating rules based constitution sricharan amarnath yeah understood sricharan amarnath understood akash ambadas salmuthe quarantine llm akash ambadas salmuthe yeah yeah yeah rinisha ohh rinisha rinisha sricharan amarnath something similar assume assures uh responsibly ok azure responsibly like high level thing high level meaning sricharan amarnath uh sricharan amarnath certain limit know akash ambadas salmuthe sricharan amarnath 60 securities put model cloud wanted check things sricharan amarnath cannot know sricharan amarnath yeah yeah sricharan amarnath correct sricharan amarnath exactly sricharan amarnath exactly akash ambadas salmuthe like transparency like fairness inclusiveness safety privacy broadband rinisha umm rinisha sure rinisha sricharan amarnath umm aspect things capture right else like know 1 aspect like every cloud provider going provide uh eventually end day like know open azure providing 1 even aws going provide one right default leverage put like good things add one way e sricharan amarnath check input going bigger problem right sricharan amarnath lucky akash ambadas salmuthe umm sricharan amarnath ok uh sricharan amarnath wanted differentiate sricharan amarnath capturing validating first shape 2nd sheet validating ok protecting youre know safeguarding rinisha umm rinisha umm sricharan amarnath ok lets say contest like constitutional means certain policies placed country level even generic level im going validate ok sricharan amarnath sricharan amarnath uh misusing rinisha yeah counterpart rlhf rinisha human feedback sricharan amarnath rinisha ai feedback trained constitution sricharan amarnath hmm ok rinisha yeah rinisha come pros cons though rinisha would cons rinisha see uh based constitution biased also biased akash ambadas salmuthe bias sense data trained like europe american legion work india akash ambadas salmuthe maybe rules cultures maybe beliefs may biased us nothing figment sricharan amarnath hmm ok rinisha think approaches rinisha would know helpful us case client engagements sricharan amarnath yeah sricharan amarnath yeah could useful right sricharan amarnath uh definitely would useful rinisha bring value approaches comes client work bring value things sricharan amarnath see correct need think use case something according like know lets say launching conversational ai chat bot public public one rinisha hmm sricharan amarnath ok public one uh ask properly responding opening differently going know big problem right sricharan amarnath launching public lets say uh example providing fake gene based chat bot app know sricharan amarnath uh customer support know putting global website website go somewhere sricharan amarnath ok log pepsico site ask questions sricharan amarnath secured way sricharan amarnath asked uh something related know sricharan amarnath uh policy wise funded like know sricharan amarnath promptly respond way stating know hey able answer type things sricharan amarnath cannot

sricharan amarnath correct rinisha yeah use case ok rinisha sure rinisha sure sricharan amarnath going take time uh go websites websites people putting like people putting hey solve security rinisha umm sricharan amarnath practice way governing way trying know focus areas trying achieve way thats going project akash ambadas salmuthe like uh like generalized form might giving us much value decided

sricharan amarnath akash ambadas salmuthe value generate value uh instead going like globally become centralized per use cases akash ambadas salmuthe uhhuh sricharan amarnath see guess going put

validations akash ambadas salmuthe umm rinisha umm sricharan amarnath way know capabilities tested like life cycle go enterprise level like gonna state high level points thats ok rinisha ok sricharan amarnath define like itll give rinisha translate deck ok sricharan amarnath correct rinisha im presentable deck rinisha got sricharan amarnath exactly yeah rinisha apart think ok 1 testing tool one presentation one poc right rinisha guess poc constitutionally right might make sense comes specific client youre mean fine tuning llm specific client domain data right rinisha happens client would like apples would set license agreement set rules rinisha constitution know train right rinisha maybe umm rinisha attract clients right rinisha ok kind approach going safeguard data llm rinisha would one potential poc area guess rinisha think sricharan amarnath yeah sricharan amarnath yeah definitely yeah rinisha ok akash ambadas salmuthe questions like suggested akash ambadas salmuthe uh reboot right akash ambadas salmuthe actually tried wont able connect like playground akash ambadas salmuthe tried 23 api provided akash ambadas salmuthe one said like exhausted makes tries rinisha yeah geddam noticed rebug rinisha yeah good work know rinisha yeah akash ambadas salmuthe alpha stage actually even beta akash ambadas salmuthe might like development stage early development stage akash ambadas salmuthe yeah like yeah went akash ambadas salmuthe nothing dedicated right quarantine akash ambadas salmuthe llm check akash ambadas salmuthe hello sricharan amarnath yeah akash ambadas salmuthe ok sricharan amarnath sorry kind lost moment rinisha ok akash ambadas salmuthe ok sricharan amarnath akash ambadas salmuthe yeah sricharan amarnath come back moment please akash ambadas

amarnath ok rinisha know matching service evaluated llama index also sricharan amarnath ok sricharan amarnath yeah rinisha ok last couple days know tried know used llama index mentioned article saying better searching indexing right sricharan amarnath correct rinisha noticed see framework right underdeveloped sricharan amarnath uh rinisha lot low level coding see lang chain already know tons high level coding high level components already created rinisha example metadata tagging right rinisha llama index option even working perfectly rinisha sit know know prompting everything rinisha langchain everything already sricharan amarnath ok rinisha noticed see github community llama index uh rinisha open akash llama index lunch change see contributors releases everything right rinisha llama index lang chain 5 times bigger llama index fastly growing rinisha think would maybe overpass llama index also maybe days akash ambadas salmuthe llama index one rinisha thats think per github github laminex github rinisha contributes contribution much lang chain rinisha thats thought ok ill go ahead langchain know lot low level coding rinisha ok around 300 sricharan amarnath one second one second sricharan amarnath give one second rinisha ok sricharan amarnath texting pepsico team second rinisha dont rinisha scroll showed contributors ok akash ambadas salmuthe looking much one 15 language
